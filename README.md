QNAP ransomware recovery, handling files recovered by PhotoRec

Note that this probably duplicates existing QNAP tool of the same name.  
I'm using this to be able to track recovery as it happens, and allow for deletion of irrelevant files, thus reducing the total disk-space needed, as well as to allow me more 'delicate' control of recovery of files with multiple possible matches.
